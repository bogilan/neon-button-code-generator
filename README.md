# Neon Button Code Generator
The Neon Button Code Generator is a simple web application built with CSS and JavaScript that allows users to create stylish neon buttons for their websites.
Users can customize the button's properties, such as the color, font, size, and border radius. Additionally, users can add a neon effect to the button on hover, making it stand out even more.

Once the user has customized the button to their liking, they can click on the button itself to generate the CSS code for the neon button.
This code can then be copied and pasted into the user's website, saving them time and effort in creating the button themselves.

The Neon Button Code Generator is easy to use and can be accessed via any modern web browser.
It's a great tool for web developers and designers who want to add a touch of style to their website's buttons.
